# Cafeteria Food Fight

**Git commits:** Do not add Claude as a co-author. No `Co-Authored-By` trailers.

**Keep this file up to date.** When adding new systems, files, plugins, constants, or architectural patterns, update the relevant sections here before finishing the work.

**Update README.md when finishing any task.** Keep the gameplay description and project status checklist current — add features to the bullet list, tick completed items, and remove anything that's no longer accurate.

2D top-down multiplayer food fight game. Students battle with food in a school cafeteria while avoiding patrolling NPC authority figures. Built with Rust + Bevy 0.15.

## Tech Stack

- **Bevy 0.15** (ECS game engine)
- **rand 0.8** (food/launcher randomization)
- **gilrs** (gamepad input via Bevy's built-in `bevy_gilrs` feature — default backend)
- **steamworks 0.12.2** (Steam Input API — optional, enabled with `--features steam`)
- **No physics engine** — custom AABB collision
- **No tilemap crate yet** — map is procedurally spawned colored rectangles

## Build & Run

```bash
cargo run                    # gilrs gamepad backend (default)
cargo run --features steam   # Steam Input backend (requires Steam running)
cargo run --release
```

Platform-specific: Linux gets borderless fullscreen + scale factor override 1.0 (Steam Deck). macOS gets windowed 1280x800.

## Game State Flow

```
MainMenu → Lobby → Playing ⇄ Paused
                  Playing → RoundOver → MainMenu
```

States defined in `states.rs`: `MainMenu` (default), `Lobby`, `MapSelect` (stub), `Loading` (stub), `Playing`, `Paused`, `RoundOver`.

The `Gameplay` marker component is added to all in-game entities and used for bulk cleanup on return to MainMenu.

`GameSessionActive` is a marker resource inserted once on the first `OnEnter(Playing)` transition. It prevents spawn/setup systems from re-running when unpausing.

## Plugin Registration Order (main.rs)

1. `DefaultPlugins` (with `ImagePlugin::default_nearest()` for pixel art)
2. `SpritePlugin` — loads sprite assets (must precede gameplay plugins)
3. `AudioPlugin` — registers `SoundEvent`, loads `SoundAssets`, plays sounds on `Update`
4. `SteamInputPlugin` (feature-gated) — must precede `InputPlugin`; populates `ControllerRegistry` via Steam Input
5. `InputPlugin` — registers `ControllerRegistry`, runs gilrs population system in `PreUpdate`
6. `ControllerPlugin` — gamepad debug logging, disconnect → auto-pause, reconnect logging
7. `LobbyPlugin` — lobby UI, join/leave/ready, spawns players on `OnEnter(Playing)`
8. `PlayerPlugin` — input→velocity, movement, animation (FixedUpdate, gated on Playing)
9. `FoodPlugin` — food spawns, throwing, launchers, trajectories (FixedUpdate, gated on Playing)
10. `CombatPlugin` — food-player collision (FixedUpdate, gated on Playing)
11. `NpcPlugin` — NPC spawning, detection, patrol, chase, catch (FixedUpdate, gated on Playing)
12. `MapPlugin` — cafeteria spawn, wall collision (FixedUpdate, gated on Playing)
13. `UiPlugin` — main menu, HUD, pause, round over, cleanup

## Input Architecture

All input flows through a backend-agnostic abstraction in `src/input.rs`.

### ControllerInput (component on player entities)

```rust
pub struct ControllerInput {
    pub move_stick: Vec2,      // left stick, 0.15 deadzone applied
    pub aim_stick: Vec2,       // right stick, 0.15 deadzone applied
    pub pickup_food: ButtonState,
    pub pickup_launcher: ButtonState,
    pub fire: ButtonState,     // throw food / fire launcher
    pub pause: ButtonState,    // pause/unpause, ready-up, menu select
    pub join: ButtonState,     // lobby join / menu confirm (South)
    pub leave: ButtonState,    // lobby leave / menu back (East)
    pub exit_game: ButtonState, // quit app (Select)
}
// ButtonState has: pressed, just_pressed, just_released
// ControllerInput::aim_direction() → right stick, falls back to left stick, default Vec2::Y
```

Gameplay systems read `ControllerInput` directly — never query `Gamepad` or use Steam Input handles.

### ControllerRegistry (resource)

```rust
pub struct ControllerRegistry {
    pub controllers: Vec<RegisteredController>,  // id: ControllerId, input: ControllerInput
}
```

Menu/lobby systems iterate `registry.controllers` to detect any-controller input (join, leave, ready). Populated each frame in `PreUpdate` by whichever backend is active.

### ControllerId (enum)

```rust
pub enum ControllerId {
    Bevy(Entity),             // gilrs backend: Bevy gamepad entity
    #[cfg(feature = "steam")]
    Steam(u64),               // Steam backend: InputHandle_t
}
```

Stored in `PlayerSlot::controller_id` (lobby) and `ControllerLink` (player entity component). Backend switching: when Steam Input detects controllers, `steam_input_populate` replaces the registry contents; gilrs data is ignored for those frames.

### Gilrs (default) path

`gilrs_populate_system` in `PreUpdate`:
- Rebuilds `ControllerRegistry` from all `Query<(Entity, &Gamepad)>`
- Updates `ControllerInput` on player entities via their `ControllerLink`
- Button mapping: South=pickup_food/join, West=pickup_launcher, RT=fire, Start=pause, East=leave, Select=exit_game

### Steam Input path (`--features steam`)

`SteamInputPlugin` in `src/steam.rs`:
- `Client::init_app(480)` → `SteamAppClient` resource (480 = SpaceWar dev app ID)
- Action sets: `GameplayControls` (move/aim/pickup_food/pickup_launcher/fire/pause) and `MenuControls` (navigate/join/leave/pause/exit_game) — defined in `steam_input_manifest.vdf`
- Action set switching: `OnEnter(Playing)` activates `GameplayControls`, all other states activate `MenuControls`
- `steam_input_populate` in `PreUpdate` (after `run_steam_callbacks`): clears registry, re-populates from `get_connected_controllers()`
- Previous-frame tracking (`SteamPrevState`) for `just_pressed`/`just_released` edge detection (Steam only gives current state)

### Gamepad button → ControllerInput mapping

| Physical button | gilrs `GamepadButton` | Steam action name |
|---|---|---|
| Left stick | `LeftStickX/Y` | `move` (analog) |
| Right stick | `RightStickX/Y` | `aim` (analog) |
| South (A/X/B) | `South` | `pickup_food` / `join` |
| West (X/□/Y) | `West` | `pickup_launcher` |
| RT | `RightTrigger2` | `fire` |
| Start | `Start` | `pause` |
| East (B/○/A) | `East` | `leave` |
| Select | `Select` | `exit_game` |

### Keyboard fallbacks

- Space: navigate menus, quick-start lobby (auto-joins all controllers), unpause
- Escape: pause
- Q: exit game (from pause screen)

## Key Architecture Patterns

### Player Spawning

Players are NOT hardcoded. The `Lobby` resource (`Vec<PlayerSlot>`) manages join/leave. `spawn_players_from_lobby` runs on `OnEnter(Playing)` (guarded by `GameSessionActive` to skip on unpause) and creates player entities with:
- `ControllerLink(slot.controller_id)` — binds player to controller
- `ControllerInput::default()` — populated each frame by the input backend

### Food System

8 food types with distinct stats (damage, speed, trajectory kind). 6 launcher types with cooldowns, multipliers, and limited uses. Three trajectory systems: straight, arc (simulated Z with gravity), bounce (wall reflection). Food spawns at fixed points with 5-second respawn timers.

### Launcher Spawning

Single spawn point at map center (0, 0). One launcher spawns immediately on game start. After pickup (or uses exhausted), a new random launcher respawns after **20 seconds**. Implemented via `LauncherSpawnPoint` component (mirrors `FoodSpawnPoint` pattern): `active=true` while pickup present, `reset_launcher_spawn_point_system` detects pickup gone → starts timer, `launcher_respawn_system` fires when timer finishes.

### Elimination & Detention

When a player's health hits zero they are eliminated:

1. `Eliminated` marker component added; `EquippedLauncher`, `ChargingShot`, and held food removed.
2. `detention_system` (runs after `movement_system`) snaps them to their corner table and zeroes velocity every tick.
3. Eliminated players are excluded from food/launcher pickup & throw, NPC detection/chase/catch, and projectile collision.
4. Win condition: ≤1 non-eliminated player remaining (among ≥2 total) → `RoundOver`. Surviving player wins.

**Corner assignment** (`DETENTION_CORNERS` in `player/components.rs`, indexed by `player.id - 1`):

| Player | Corner | Position |
|--------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Bottom-left | (-400, -260) |
| 2 | Bottom-right | (400, -260) |
| 3 | Top-left | (-400, 260) |
| 4 | Top-right | (400, 260) |

Corner tables are visual-only sprites (no `Wall` component) in `map/loading.rs`.

### NPC State Machine

`NpcState` enum: `Patrolling` → `Suspicious` → `Chasing` → `Returning` → `Patrolling`. Detection uses cone check (angle + distance). NPCs change sprite color based on state (yellow=suspicious, red=chasing). Three NPCs: Teacher (medium speed, patrols tables), Principal (slow, wide detection), Lunch Lady (stationary at counter). Janitor is a planned fourth role (not yet spawned).

**Teacher special rule:** `teacher_launcher_alert_system` (runs before `detection_system`) immediately forces Teacher into `Chasing` toward the nearest player holding an `EquippedLauncher` — bypasses cone and distance checks entirely. Teacher resumes normal detection once no player holds a launcher.

### Audio

Sound effects use a simple event-driven pattern in `src/audio.rs`:

1. Gameplay systems send `SoundEvent` variants (e.g., `sound.send(SoundEvent::FoodHit)`)
2. `play_sounds` system (Update) reads the events and spawns `(AudioPlayer(handle), PlaybackSettings::DESPAWN)` — entities auto-despawn when playback finishes
3. Round-over fanfare is triggered directly via `OnEnter(GameState::RoundOver)` — no event needed

**SoundEvent variants and where they're sent:**

| Variant | Sent from |
|---|---|
| `FoodPickup` | `food/throwing.rs` → `pickup_system` |
| `FoodThrow` | `food/throwing.rs` → `throw_system` |
| `LauncherPickup` | `food/launcher.rs` → `launcher_pickup_system` |
| `LauncherFire` | `food/launcher.rs` → `launcher_fire_system`, `catapult_charge_system` |
| `FoodHit` | `combat/collision.rs` → `food_player_collision_system` |
| `PlayerCaught` | `npc/chase.rs` → `catch_system` |

Sound files live in `assets/sounds/*.ogg`. Sources and original filenames documented in `ATTRIBUTIONS.md`. Bevy logs an asset error (no crash) if a file is missing — audio for that event is silently skipped.

### Map Layout

Procedural cafeteria: 960x640 play area centered at origin. Bounds: ±480 x, ±320 y. Perimeter walls (16px thick), 6 tables in 2x3 grid, lunch counter at top, 2 pillars, 2 door markers. Everything uses the `Wall { half_size }` component for AABB collision.

## Assets

All gameplay entities use sprite atlases loaded from `assets/sprites/`. The map still uses procedural colored rectangles (no tilemap).

### Sprite Atlases

- **Players** (`sprites/players/player_{blue,red,green,yellow}.png`) — 32x32, 8×4 grid
  - Rows: walk_down (0), walk_up (1), walk_left (2), walk_right (3)
  - Cols 0–3: walk frames (8fps), 4–5: idle (3fps), 6–7: stunned (4fps)
  - Row 3 cols 4–5: holding_food idle (3fps)
  - Helper: `player_atlas_index(row, col)` (8 columns)

- **Teacher** (`sprites/npcs/teacher.png`) — 32x32, 7×4 grid
- **Principal** (`sprites/npcs/principal.png`) — 32x32, 7×4 grid
  - Both share `npc_standard_animation_for()`: rows 0–2 = patrol/suspicious/chase, 4 directions per row; row 3 = returning
  - Helper: `atlas_index(row, col, 7)`

- **Lunch Lady** (`sprites/npcs/lunch_lady.png`) — 32x32, 6×3 grid
  - Row 0: idle_stir (2fps), Row 1: suspicious_stir (2fps), Row 2: swing_left / swing_right (6fps)

- **Food** (`sprites/food/food_items.png`) — 16x16, 8×8 grid
  - One row per food type (see `food_type_row()`): Pizza=0, Meatball=1, Jello=2, Grape=3, MilkCarton=4, Spaghetti=5, BananaPeel=6, MysteryMeat=7
  - Helper: `food_atlas_index(row, col)` (8 columns)

- **Launchers** (`sprites/launchers/launchers.png`) — 32x32, 5×6 grid
  - One row per launcher type (see `launcher_type_row()`): Slingshot=0, KetchupGun=1, SporkLauncher=2, LunchTrayCatapult=3, StrawBlowgun=4, WatermelonCatapult=5
  - Helper: `launcher_atlas_index(row, col)` (5 columns)

- **Effects** (`sprites/effects/effects.png`) — 32x32, 6×3 grid
  - Row 1: splat decals by food type — col 0=red, 1=green, 2=purple, 3=white, 4=yellow, 5=brown
  - `food_splat_index(food_type)` maps food type → correct splat column
  - Helper: `effects_atlas_index(row, col)` (6 columns)

### Map
Procedural colored rectangles: floor=dark brown, walls=brown, tables=tan, counter=beige, door markers=lighter brown.

## Bevy 0.15 API Notes

These tripped us up and will trip you up too:

- `GamepadConnectionEvent` and `GamepadConnection` are NOT in `bevy::prelude::*` — import from `bevy::input::gamepad`
- `GamepadConnection::Connected` is a **struct variant** not a tuple: `Connected { name, vendor_id, product_id }` — destructure with `{ name, .. }`
- Gamepad input: `Query<(Entity, &Gamepad)>`, then `gamepad.just_pressed(GamepadButton::South)`, `gamepad.get(GamepadAxis::LeftStickX)`
- Sprite with image: `Sprite { image: asset_server.load("path.png"), custom_size: Some(...), ..default() }`
- `ImagePlugin::default_nearest()` is set for pixel-perfect rendering
- Use `FixedUpdate` for gameplay, `Update` for UI
- State gating: `.run_if(in_state(GameState::Playing))`
- Event sending: `EventWriter::send(event)` — NOT `.write()` (that method does not exist in 0.15)

## steamworks 0.12.2 API Notes

These are different from older `steamworks-rs` examples you'll find online:

- `Client` has **no generic parameters** — it's just `Client`, not `Client<ClientManager>`
- `Client::init_app(app_id)` returns `Result<Client, SteamAPIInitError>` — **single value**, not a tuple `(Client, SingleClient)`
- There is **no `SingleClient`** — `run_callbacks()` is a method on `Client` directly
- `Client` is `Send + Sync` — store as a regular Bevy `Resource`, call `run_callbacks()` from any thread
- Handle types (`InputHandle_t`, `InputActionSetHandle_t`, etc.) live in `steamworks::sys`, not the top-level crate — requires `features = ["raw-bindings"]` in `Cargo.toml`
- `InputAnalogActionData_t` fields: `.x` and `.y` (lowercase)
- `InputDigitalActionData_t` field: `.bState` (camelCase — matches the C struct)
- `Input` struct also has no generic parameters: `steamworks::Input`, not `Input<ClientManager>`
- steam_appid.txt with value `480` in the working directory lets you run without Steam launching the app (uses Valve's SpaceWar test app)
